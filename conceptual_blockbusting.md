Review
This is one of those books you'll want to read once a year. It provides practical steps for expanding your mind, teaches you to think about thinking, and helps you identify "conceptual blocks". These blocks are limiting your ideas and keeping you from reaching higher levels of creativity. The subject of the book seems a bit elementary based on the title - "Conceptual Blockbusting", but there is a lot to be learned. Don't assume it is just another book about problem solving.

Practical steps for expanding your mind
This book will help you get unstuck when problem solving. We all fall into familiar thinking patterns
when we are trying to solve problems. Often times we just need to apply a different thinking strategy or language 
(visual, mathematical, verbal, etc) in order to see the problem in a different way and help get unstuck.
Adams does a great job of proving and reinforcing the concepts with exercises throughout the book.
I was surprised by how often I fell right into the traps of these exercises and how well they highlighted
my familiar (and limiting) thinking patterns.

Thinking about thinking
The ideas in this book are very closely related to mindfulness, but with an emphasis toward problem solving and creativity.
Adams teaches us to think about thinking in the same way that a golfer would think about his golf form.
There are certainly better forms of thinking that can be identified and practiced. In fact, Adams argues
that it is similar to a muscle that can be exercised and strengthened. 

Identify "Conceptual blocks"
You will start to realize all the conceptual "blocks" that are obstructing on your ideas. These include
perceptual blocks like stereotyping, delimiting the problem too closely, inability to see the problem from
various viewpoints. They include emotional blocks like the fear of taking a risk, no appetite for chaos,
and judging rather than generating new ideas. They also include cultural and environmental blocks like
taboos, traditions and changes, and non-supportive environments. A lot of these blocks may seem intuitive,
but it's important to remember them and identify them in our thinking patterns.

Conclusion
I wish this book was a little better organized and had a summary at the end. It would be nice to
go back and review the conceptual blocks. Also, the pictures and diagrams were fun and interesting, 
but seemed mostly random. Overall, I highly recommend reading this book to expose the mental blocks which are holding
back your ideas. You'll have a surge of new ideas after reading it and you'll start looking at your 
problems in new and useful ways.

Since there is not one, I put together a list of most of the blocks here.
Ideally each block listed had a quick 1-2 sentence description (something to add the next time I read this book).

1. Perceptual Blocks
Seeing what you expect to see (Stereotyping)
Difficulty in isolating the problem
Tendency to delimit the problem area too closely
Inability to see the problem from various viewpoints
Saturation
Failure to utilize all sensory inputs

2. Emotional Blocks
Fear of taking a risk
No appetite for chaos
Judging rather than generating ideas
Inability to incubate
Lack of challenge versus excessive zeal
Reality and fantasy

3. Cultural and Environmental Blocks
Taboos
Humor in problem-solving
Reason and intutition
Left-handed and right-handed thinking
Primary and secondary creativity
Tradition and change
Autocratic bosses
Non-support
