Course: Learning How to Learn
Book: A Mind for Numbers
Author: Barbara Oakley, Ph.D.

How often do you feel like you don't remember much from a book you read a few months ago? Or how often do you think about all the classes you took in high school and college, but don't remember much from? These are problems I've thought a lot about when I invest time into reading a technical book, or taking an online course, or learning something new in general. How do I know that I am actually learning and retaining the information that I read? This was the main motivation behind signing up for the popular online Coursera course "Learning How to Learn". The book "A Mind for Numbers" is the supplementary book for the course. This blog post will be a review of the book and a review of the online course.

To start, Barbara Oakley is a very natural teacher, she speaks/writes clearly and gets straight to the point. Also she is very relatable for people. A main point of the book is that she hated math and science growing up, thought she didn't have the talent for it, but ended up becoming a professor of engineering - making the argument that you can learn anything if you have the right strategies.

I found most of the information in the course is already well-known. Example: the best way to learn is to recall what you've learned, to test yourself, and to do it repeatedly over increasing amounts of time. This is why we forget most of what we learned in college. We aren't testing ourselves on the things we've learned, mostly because we don't need to. But for the things we do want to remember, the things that are directly relevant to our career, hobbies, etc. we need to be testing ourselves. Other examples of well-known study techniques which are known, but not practiced: create chunks of knowledge (group together ideas and build a single chunk which can be recalled easily), create analogies and metaphors for the things you are learning (the crazier, more visual, more vivid the better), create an environment where you have absolute focus (use the pomodoro technique of 25 minutes studying and 5 minutes relaxing).

An interesting concept in the book/course was "illusions of competence". These are feelings we get from thinking we understand something when we really don't. The best example is when you look at a problem, then go right to the back of the book to find the solution. You read the solution and think it makes sense to you and then you move on. But this is an illusion of competence. You don't actually understand something until you are able to do it yourself. Other ways we trick ourselves into illusions of competence are passively rereading text, highlighting text and resolving the same problems over and over again.

Overall, I really enjoyed the book/course. Nothing mind-blowing, but a great reminder to be more diligent and more purposeful with my learning. I think everyone could benefit a lot by taking the course.
